  Project Description
  
This project is a simple implementation of a BASIC interpreter. It is capable of parsing and executing BASIC code, supporting basic operations like variable assignment, arithmetic operations, printing, and conditional loops. The interpreter is designed to help run simple programs and algorithms written in BASIC without needing to use advanced constructs like recursion or arrays.
